## Sample Considerations

We want to sample from every _taluka_ or _subdivision_ for rural Kambar and Karachi 
East respectively. So we want to know, should we sample villages such that we 
observe many __STCs__ and few 
__TCs__ per __STC__; or should we sample villages such that we 
observe many __TCs__ per __STC__ and relatively 
fewer __STCs__. 

The Karachi East analog is should we sample blocks so that we see many __charges__ 
and few __circles__ per __charge__ or blocks such that we see few __charges__ but 
many __circles__ per __charge__.

In a first best scenario we'd sample as many STCs/Charges as possible. However, 
it costs more to sample  a greater number of STCs/Charges because the location of each 
village/block will be more dispersed. In other words, it's cheaper to sample 
many TCs/circles per STC/charge but we learn less about zero-dose 
children because of intra-cluster correlation.    


## Calculating ICC


We think literacy rate is highly (negatively) correlated to zero dose rate. For 
instance, a UN survey of Karachi's slums found that conditional on being a zero 
dose child, 93\% of mothers were illiterate. Therefore using village/circle level 
literacy data we calculate literacy ICC and use this in place of zero dose ICC.

We calculate ICC using two methods: one uses the normal approximation to the 
Binomial and calculates the classic sum of squares within village/circle vs sum of 
squares between villages/circles. The other uses a random effects logistic model 
(which itself has to take a first order approximation). The final ICC used 
splits the difference and averages over these two methods to give rural Kambar 
$= 0.131$ and Karachi East $= 0.172$. 


_Ideally we'd calculate the correlation structure of charges and then circles 
within charges and make our simulations reflect this nested correlation 
structure but this would be a bit involved._


## Creating Simulated data

We draw simulated probabilities of village/circle level zero dose rate that are 
tailored to be centered around 0.05 (again based off the UN Karachi slum study) 
with a correlation of -0.9 with village/circle literacy rate. This gives simulated 
0 vax probabilities:

```{r imp-0}
include_graphics("../../data/output/hh-survey/kambar-imp-0-dose.png")

include_graphics("../../data/output/hh-survey/karachi-imp-0-dose.png")
```



Next, we need to simulate individual level binary data given our 0 dose probabilities 
and estimated ICC values. Fortunately, this can be done by simulating from the 
beta-binomial distribution. In the conventional binomial distribution the probability 
of success in each trial is fixed - in the beta-binomial distribution the probability 
of success is itself a random variable drawn from the beta distribution. Using 
our ICC and average probability of 0 doses we can solve for the parameters of the 
beta-binomial that correspond to our problem and use this to simulate 0 vax children.


## Creating a sampling plan 

We sample one village/block per TC/circle and sample at least $x$ many TCs/circles 
per STC/charge where $x$ is a simulation parameter. If there are any "spare" 
villages/blocks left over after assigning $x$ TCs/circles per charge per STC/subdivision 
we completely randomly allocate the remaining villages. 

_Random allocation of 
remainders is something we can change - for instance we could try and stratify on 
STC/subdivision, assign remainders equally, and then randomly allocate any leftovers._


# Running the simulation

We vary the total number of units sampled and the number of units per group (i.e. 
number of TCs per STC) and simulate each hyperparameter combination 200 times. Then 
we estimate the 0 vax rate in each simulated draw and calculate the corresponding 
clustered standard error. Our goal is to tradeoff sample size/sampling cost 
against standard error size.
