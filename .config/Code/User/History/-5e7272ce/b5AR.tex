Ashraf et al. investigate the optimal strategy for the recruitment of public 
healthcare workers whilst trying to balance incentives for talent with prosociality 
in Zambia.
There are concerns that raising pay for community healthcare jobs will attract job applicants 
with low prosociality but greater career concerns/money motivation etc. - this 
is undesirable for the government since prosocial workers tend to be more 
productive than their career-minded counterparts
