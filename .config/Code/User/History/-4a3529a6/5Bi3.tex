\section{Experimenter Demand Effects in the Lab}
%------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Experimenter Demand Effects}
    
    Experimenter demand effects (EDEs)  occur when participants know they're being experimented upon 
    and change their behaviour.

    \vfill
    EDEs induce external validity issues as behaviour would be different in 
    absence of the experimenter.

    Some examples:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Authority" figure effect (French and Raven 1959)
        \item Expectations of reciprocity from experimenter
        \item Social desirability bias
        \item Anonymity or lack thereof
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%------------------------------------------------


\begin{frame}{EDE Solutions}


Many experiments, either in the lab or the field, try and shutdown 
    experimenter demand channels:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Obfuscated follow-up - follow-ups presented as independent study to participants.
        \item List methods - veil individual respondent answers.
        \item Neutral framing - experiment instructions shouldn't draw attention to the experiment's purpose.
        \item Obfuscated information - treatment information is revealed alongside irrelevant information.
        \item de Quidt et al. (2018) provide bounds for estimating bias induced by "demand 
    treatments" 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{How bad are EDEs?}

To measure EDE magnitudes de Quidt et al. create a "strong" and "weak" positive/negative demand effect 
    across 11 lab games on MTurk.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Weak:}  "We expect that participants who are shown these instructions will [work, invest, ...] more/less than they
        normally would."
        \item  \textbf{Strong:}  "You will do us a favor if you [work, invest, ...] more/less than
you normally would."
    \end{itemize}

    

\end{frame}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{EDE Magnitudes III}

    They label effects as moderate to small:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  "Weak" treatment induced a 0.13 standard deviation change on average.
        \item "Strong" treatment induced an average of 0.6 standard deviations with a 
        range of 0.23 to 1.06 SDs.
    \end{itemize}



    We have less evidence of this effect in the field where stakes are much 
    higher:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dictator game involved splitting \$1.
        \item Value of time elicited using 10 cents today or in a week's time
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{My Goal}

    If all it takes to generate larger treatment effects is the 
    statement "You will do us a favor if you..." from a policy point of view, this is a relatively cheap addition to any 
    intervention.

    \vfill
    Therefore, my goal is to quantify how best to create experimenter demand effects in a field 
    setting that can be scaled to a wider population.

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Implications from the Lab}
    Lab experiments suggests:
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Women are more likely to try and please an interviewer than men (respond 0.15 SD 
            more than men in the strong treatment).
            \item Stating the experimenter's preferences are more effective than the 
            experiment hypothesis ("You will do us a favor..." vs "We expect that...")
            \item We still need to shutdown some experimenter effects and measure objective outcomes.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Dhar, Jain and Jayachandran (2018) show that social desirability bias is 
                associated with under/over estimates using self-reported outcomes. 
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    Possible treatment arms:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Framing/anchoring - "We believe the treatment will increase outcome A by XYZ"
        \item Weak demand effect - "We expect that participants who are shown these instructions will 
        work more than they normally would"
        \item Strong demand effect - "You will do us a favor if you work more than you normally would" 
        \item Experiment information - "We are studying..."
    \end{itemize}
