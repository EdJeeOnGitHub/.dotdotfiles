\maketitle

My research interests are at the intersection of programme evaluation and machine 
learning, particularly with an application towards development economics. One 
of my projects seeks to synthesise observational and experimental evidence to 
estimate the effect of mobile conditional cash transfers (mCCTs) on 
child vaccination rates in Sindh, Pakistan. Whilst we have experimental variation 
in seven districts through a staggered roll-out design, we observe outcomes for 
the universe of children in the remaining 23 districts. Furthermore, the implementing 
partner chose the seven districts with the lowest vaccination rates as candidates 
for the experimental treatment. Therefore, the goal is to combine causal inference, 
through careful modelling of the selection mechanism using Borusyak and Hull (2021), 
with machine learning style estimators to improve precision of the RCT estimates 
leveraging "big data" from the remaining observational districts.
