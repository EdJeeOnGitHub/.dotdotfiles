Start with a classic simultaneous equation model:

\begin{align*}
    Y_1 &= X_1 \xi_1 + X_2 \pi_1 + U_1 \\
    Y_2 = X_1 \xi_2 + X_2 \pi_2 + U_2
\end{align*}

We're going to treat $Y_1$ as our endogenous variable and $Y_2$ as our outcome 
of interest. $X_1$ is a matrix of exogenous controls and $X_2$ are our instruments 
(people call these excluded instruments).

Instrumental variables/Two stage least squares states that:

\begin{align*}
    Y_2 &= X_1 \delta + Y_1 \gamma + V
\end{align*}


which is to say $Y_1$ is a function of exogenous controls and our endogenous $Y_1$. 
This is also where the term excluded instrument comes from - $X_2$ only influences 
$Y_2$ through $Y_1$.
