\maketitle


Our primary goal is to estimate the effect of mobile Conditional Cash Transfers (mCCTs)
on the number of vaccinations\footnote{Penta-1 and Measles-1 have been identified as 
our main focus} administered in 7 districts in Sindh\footnote{TODO: List 
districts here.}. As a secondary goal, we'd like to estimate to what extent these 
estimates are externally valid, and whether we can extrapolate estimated treatment 
effects to similar districts not in the RCT.

Due to the ZM data, we have 



\section{Estimation}


\textit{It's not entirely clear to me what level of data aggregation we're going to have 
access to - for now let's index $i$ for individuals, UCs, whatever.}



The simplest way to estimate the effect of mCCTs on vaccination numbers is a 
"static" TWFE-regression:


\begin{align*}
   Y_{idt} &= \delta_d + \tau_t + \beta \text{treat}_{idt} + \varepsilon_{idt} 
\end{align*}

Traditionally, we interpret $\hat{\beta}$ as the difference-in-differences estimator 
and the programme $ATT$. However, in the presence of staggered treatment timing 
(which we face, as each district is rolled into treatment at different times) the 
static TWFE regression makes "forbidden" comparisons. As described by Goodman-Bacon, rather than comparing treated 
units to un-treated units we compare later treated units to earlier treated units.
