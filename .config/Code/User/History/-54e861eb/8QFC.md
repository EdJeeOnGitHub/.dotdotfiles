I TA'ed Big Data Tools for Economics for Professor Thibaut Lamadon - his course website can be found 
[here](http://econ21340.lamadon.com/). The course is taught in Python and focused 
on computational methods applied to 'big' datasets for causal inference.

Student feedback can be found at the bottom of this [page](http://EdJeeOnGitHub.github.io/files/teaching-reviews/2021-big-data-in-econ.pdf).
