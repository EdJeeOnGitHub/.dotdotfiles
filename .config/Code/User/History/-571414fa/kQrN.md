I TA'ed the first course in UChicago's Honors Econometrics sequence under 
[Francesco Ruggieri](https://economics.uchicago.edu/directory/francesco-ruggieri). 

This was one of the hardest and most rewarding classes I've had the pleasure to 
teach so far, UChicago's honors metrics students are smart cookies.
