\subsection*{a}
A surprising puzzle in development, and in economics generally, is the presence 
of publication bias. If economists were rational Bayesian updaters they would 
seek to publish all rigorously derived results and update their posterior beliefs 
about a topic based on the distribution of research results. However, in reality 
there is a bias towards significant results being published in economics journals 
as documented by Brodeur et al. (2016) and Andrews and Kasy (2019). This means 
economists only observe a selected sample of signals and must update their posterior 
beliefs after deconvolving publication bias and sampling variation.
