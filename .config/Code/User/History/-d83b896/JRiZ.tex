\subsection*{a}


When $t=1$ arrives the consumer knows she must pay $(c+p)$ this period and will 
earn $b$ next period. Since she's contemporaneously discounting next period's 
consumption she correctly discounts using $\beta \delta$. This gives the 
inequality:

\begin{align*}
    \beta \delta b -c - p > 0
\end{align*}
